This is on my work computer. 
This is all you really need to know at this point for GitBash:

ls
-This lists out what is in the current directory

cd
-This is how to change a directory
cd "C:\Users\ttanita\Documents\ForGitBash"

git remote add origin "https://github.com/tytanita21/Test.git"
-Put in the link of the github repo you want.

git remote -v
-This taps into the github repo.

git add .
-This does all the files
git add "5.21.21 test.txt"
-This does a single file.

git commit -m "This is my first commit"
-You can put your commit message here.

git push origin master
-This will execute the push to the github repo.
